Welcome to Databricks web terminal! Please read the following instructions:

 * This terminal session is ${RED}${BOLD}ephemeral${NC}, so it will go away if you close or refresh the browser tab.

 * If you want to have a persistent terminal session on this cluster, please use ${YELLOW}'tmux'${NC}.

 * There is an idle timeout if no client- or server-side changes are made to the terminal session.
   Refreshing the tab would launch a new session.
