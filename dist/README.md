# RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark Distribution Packaging

The distribution module creates a jar with support for the Spark versions you need combined into a single jar.

See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) doc for details on building and profiles available to build an uber jar.

Note that when you use the profiles to build an uber jar there are currently some hardcoded service provider files that get put into place. One file for each of the
above profiles. Please note that you will need to update these if adding or removing support for a Spark version.

Files are: `com.nvidia.spark.rapids.SparkShimServiceProvider.sparkNonSnapshot`, `com.nvidia.spark.rapids.SparkShimServiceProvider.sparkSnapshot`, `com.nvidia.spark.rapids.SparkShimServiceProvider.sparkNonSnapshotDB`, and `com.nvidia.spark.rapids.SparkShimServiceProvider.sparkSnapshotDB`.

The new uber jar is structured like:

1. Base common classes are user visible classes. For these we use Spark 3.3.0 versions because they are assumed to be
bitwise-identical to the other shims, this assumption is subject to the future automatic validation.
2. META-INF/services. This is a file that has to list all the shim versions supported by this jar. 
The files talked about above for each profile are put into place here for uber jars. Although we currently do not use 
[ServiceLoader API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html) we use the same service 
provider discovery mechanism
3. META-INF base files are from 3.3.0  - maven, LICENSE, NOTICE, etc
4. Spark specific directory (aka Parallel World in the jargon of 
[ParallelWorldClassloader](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/jdk8-b120/jaxws/src/share/jaxws_classes/com/sun/istack/internal/tools/ParallelWorldClassLoader.java)) 
for each version of Spark supported in the jar, i.e., spark330/, spark341/, etc.

If you have to change the contents of the uber jar, the packaging defaults common classes to the base jar when binary dedupe proves they are bitwise-identical across shims. New common classes should normally remain unshimmed by default. The following files control explicit exceptions and non-class resources.

1. `keep-in-spark-shared.txt` - Patterns for bitwise-identical common `spark-shared` class files that must stay in `spark-shared` instead of being promoted to the base jar. This should stay small; add entries only for compatibility or packaging exceptions.
2. `unshimmed-common-from-single-shim.txt` - Files that must go into the base jar from one representative shim but are not selected by default class promotion, such as root `META-INF` resources and Python worker files. Avoid adding class files here unless they need special root-layout treatment outside bitwise-identical default promotion.
3. `unshimmed-from-each-spark3xx.txt` - This is applied to all the individual Spark specific version jars to pull any files that need to go into the base of the jar and not into the Spark specific directory. These are per-shim root artifacts rather than common `spark-shared` classes.
