# The following pipeline determines identical classes across shims in this build.
# - checksum all class files
# - move the varying-prefix sparkxyz to the left so it can be easily skipped for uniq and sort
# - sort by path, secondary sort by checksum, print one line per group
# - produce uniq count for paths
# - filter the paths with count=1, the class files without diverging checksums
# - put the path starting with /sparkxyz back together for the final list

# identical regardless of the Spark-version-specific jar.
#
# At this point the duplicate classes have not been removed from version-specific jar
# locations such as parallel-world/spark312.
# For each unshimmed class file look for all of its copies inside /spark[34]* and
# and count the number of distinct checksums. There are two representative cases
# 1) The class is contributed to the unshimmed location via the unshimmed-from-each-spark34 list. These are classes
#    carrying the shim classifier in their package name such as
#    com.nvidia.spark.rapids.spark312.RapidsShuffleManager. They are unique by construction,
#    and will have zero copies in any non-spark312 shims. Although such classes are currently excluded from
#    being copied to the /spark312 Parallel World we keep the algorithm below general without assuming this.
#
# 2) The class is contributed to the unshimmed location via unshimmed-common. These are classes that
#    that have the same package and class name across all parallel worlds.
#
#  So if the number of distinct class files per class in the unshimmed location is < 2, the jar
#  is content is as expected
#
#  If we find an unshimmed class file occurring > 1  we fail the build and the code must be refactored
#  until bitwise-identity of each unshimmed class is restored.
