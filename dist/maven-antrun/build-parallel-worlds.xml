        - Generates shim service discovery META-INF entries for ShimLoader

        - Creates per-spark-build shim root directories (parallel worlds) from versioned aggregators

        - Uses whichever aggregator from included_buildvers earliest in the list can contribute to
          the conventional class file locations (shared world) without overwriting them. This is just
          for deterministic retracing what aggregator contributed a particular file. The shared world
          files should be bitwise-identical as a rough approximation of binary compatibility.
          If we keep buildvers in a consistent order across all profiles, we should be able to fix many
          issues in one shot. The only anticipated issue is the violation of the bitwise identity check
          in the binary-dedupe script below.

        - Verifies that all public classes in the shared world can indeed be safely shared because they
          are bitwise-identical for all Spark version dependencies

        - binary-dedupe ensures that only one bitwise-identical copy per class is stored in the final jar.

        This ant script emulates compile and resource generation phases such that its output
        can be passed to the maven-jar-plugin to fit well into conventional maven execution logic
        after side-stepping it in this script.

        The script is in a dedicated file because we can't use ant refid across different maven-antrun-plugin
        executions, let alone maven profiles. It should be kept as general as possible w.r.t. to a particular
        shim mix, such that it can generically be called from any profile.

        TODO Once the caller pom is cleaned up enough it should be possible to have a single invocation of this
        ant script outside profiles, and profiles will just set different values for input properties. At this
        point it can be inlined again in pom.
