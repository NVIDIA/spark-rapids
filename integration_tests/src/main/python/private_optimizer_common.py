"""Shared helpers for the RAPIDS private-optimizer integration tests.

This module is intentionally named without the ``_test`` suffix so pytest does
not collect it as a test file. Each private-optimizer rule lives in its own
``private_optimizer_<rule>_test.py`` module and imports from here.

The covered rules are semantics-preserving but default-off in public IT.
Comparing a same-conf CPU run against a same-conf GPU run cannot tell whether a
rule actually fired, so every test built on these helpers does two things:

  1. Compares an OFF-rule CPU baseline against an ON-rule GPU run. Because the
     rules preserve semantics, OFF-CPU == ON-GPU proves both data correctness
     and GPU parity while keeping the CPU reference uncontaminated by the rule.
  2. Asserts a per-rule plan marker that appears only when the rule fires, so
     the test FAILS if the conf flip is a no-op (wrong conf, wrong query shape,
     or private jar not loaded).

See ``private_optimizer_README.md`` for how to add a new rule module.

# 330..411 plus the Databricks 400db173 buildver). Below 3.3.0 the rules are not
# present at all, so the conf flips would be silent no-ops. This is the one
# version floor we can assert from the source; runtimes within the matrix
# (including Databricks) are all supported for these four rules, so we do not
# add per-runtime skips here. A rule that becomes unsupported on some future
# runtime is caught by the plan-marker assertion below (it fails loudly instead
# of passing silently), not by guessing a version here.
