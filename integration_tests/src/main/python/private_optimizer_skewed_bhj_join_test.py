    of an AQE broadcast hash join. Needs a runtime broadcast (static
    autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1, adaptive.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=10m) so
    the streamed side is a materialized shuffle stage, plus small skew
    thresholds. Marker: the shuffle reader is 'coalesced and skewed'.

    The rule additionally short-circuits in OptimizeSkewedBHJJoinRule.apply when
    AQEUtils.isOptimizeSkewBHJSupported is false, so if a future Spark/runtime
    drops support the rule becomes a no-op and the marker assertion below fails
    loudly rather than passing silently.

    Validated with a small GLOBAL aggregate over the materialized skewed join;
    a GROUP BY on the skew key is intentionally avoided here."""
