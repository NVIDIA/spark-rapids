 * Helper object to handle [[EXECUTOR_BROADCAST]] from Databricks. Logically, an executor broadcast 
 * involves the executor "broadcasting" its data to the other executors, and then each of the 
 * executors build their own version of the broadcast relation. We accomplish a similar version 
 * of this by reading the shuffle data in each executor and passing the columnar batch data to the
 * GPU versions of BroadcastHashJoin and BroadcastNestedLoopJoin, which by necessity must build 
 * these relations on the executor because they do the work of the join on the GPU device itself,
 * which means they require a format of the data that can be used on the GPU.
