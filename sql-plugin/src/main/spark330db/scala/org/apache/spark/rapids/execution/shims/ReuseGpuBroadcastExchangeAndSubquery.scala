/**
 * GPU version of the ReuseExchangeAndSubquery rule from Apache Spark 3.2.x. This only works with
 * GpuBroadcastExchangeExec in the reuse context, since we need to skip ahead of Databricks' 
 * version of the rule which accomodates for the codegenStageId in non-GPU nodes in the Spark plan
 * for DPP. We also don't want to reuse too much, in certain circumstances if we used the Databricks
 * rule as-is, we would try to reuse non-reusable nodes in other cases that are not DPP.
 * 
 * Find out duplicated exchanges and subqueries in the whole spark plan including subqueries, then
 * use the same exchange or subquery for all the references.
 *
 * Note that the Spark plan is a mutually recursive data structure:
 * SparkPlan -> Expr -> Subquery -> SparkPlan -> Expr -> Subquery -> ...
 * Therefore, in this rule, we recursively rewrite the exchanges and subqueries in a bottom-up way,
 * in one go.
