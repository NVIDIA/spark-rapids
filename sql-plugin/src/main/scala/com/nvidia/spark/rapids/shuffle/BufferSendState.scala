/**
 * A helper case class to maintain the server side state in response to a transfer
 * request initiated by a peer.
 *
 * The class implements the Iterator interface.
 *
 * On next(), a set of RapidsBuffer are copied onto a bounce buffer, and a
 * `MemoryBuffer` slice of the bounce buffer is returned. Buffers are copied to the bounce
 * buffer in `TransferRequest` order. The receiver has the same conventions.
 *
 * Synchronization with `serverStream` is outside of this class. It is assumed that the caller
 * has several `BufferSendState` iterators and on calling next on this collection, it will
 * perform a sync on `serverStream` before handing it off to the transport.
 *
 * It also is AutoCloseable. close() should be called to free bounce buffers.
 *
 * In terms of the lifecycle of this object, it begins with the client asking for transfers to
 * start, it lasts through all buffers being transmitted, and ultimately finishes when a
 * TransferResponse is sent back to the client.
 *
 * @param transaction a request transaction
 * @param sendBounceBuffers - an object that contains a device and potentially a host
 *                          buffer also
 * @param requestHandler - impl of trait that interfaces to the catalog
 * @param serverStream - CUDA stream to use for copies.
