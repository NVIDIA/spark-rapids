/**
 * An abstract columnar batch iterator that gives options for auto closing
 * when the associated task completes. Also provides idempotent close semantics.
 *
 * This iterator follows the semantics of GPU RDD columnar batch iterators too in that
 * if a batch is returned by next it is the responsibility of the receiver to close
 * it.
 *
 * Generally it is good practice if hasNext would return false than any outstanding resources
 * should be closed so waiting for an explicit close is not needed.
 *
 * @param closeWithTask should the Iterator be closed at task completion or not.
