/**
 * GpuBubbleTime, a metric that measures periods when the GPU is underutilized during execution
 * of non-GPU workload. This helps identify CPU or IO bottlenecks preventing full GPU utilization.
 *
 * GpuBubbleTimerManager is designed to work as a singleton across the Spark executor that
 * coordinates multiple GpuBubbleTimer instances. The manager tracks GPU utilization state
 * based on the number of threads waiting for GpuSemaphore.
 *
 * GpuBubbleTimerManager applies the event-driven approach to manage the timers:
 * When there are no waiting threads (indicating GPU underutilization), all registered timers
 * start accumulating time. When threads begin waiting for GPU access (indicating GPU saturation),
 * timers are paused. All status changes are notified to the manager as soon as they occur via
 * addWaiter/removeWaiter calls.
 *
 * The manager ensures thread-safety through synchronized methods when updating timer states, and
 * uses atomic operations to track waiting thread count, providing accurate GPU bubble time metrics
 * with minimal overhead.
