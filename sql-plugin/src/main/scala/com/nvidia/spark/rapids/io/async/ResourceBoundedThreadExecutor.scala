/**
 * A thread pool executor that integrates with resource management for executing AsyncRunners.

 * This executor provides resource-aware task scheduling by:
 *   - Acquiring resources before runner execution through the ResourcePool
 *   - Tracking resource usage and releasing resources after task completion
 *   - Supporting priority-based runner ordering via PriorityBlockingQueue
 *   - Managing resource lifecycles including immediate and deferred release strategies
 *
 * AsyncRunners that cannot acquire sufficient resources within timeout are bypassed during
 * execution and re-queued to prevent starvation. The executor works exclusively with AsyncRunner
 * instances and their corresponding RapidsFutureTask wrappers.
 *
 * Resource release timing can be controlled by the implementation of the AsyncRunner.
 * Runners are able to provide callbacks for resource lifecycle management and supports both
 * immediate and deferred resource release patterns based on the corresponding AsyncResult
 * implementation.
