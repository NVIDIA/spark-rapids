/**
 * This provides a way to get back out GPU Columnar data RDD[Table]. Each Table will have the same
 * schema as the dataframe passed in.  If the schema of the dataframe is something that Rapids does
 * not currently support an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.
 *
 * The size of each table will be determined by what is producing that table but typically will be
 * about the number of bytes set by [[RapidsConf.GPU_BATCH_SIZE_BYTES]].
 *
 * Table is not a typical thing in an RDD so special care needs to be taken when working with it.
 * By default it is not serializable so repartitioning the RDD or any other operator that involves
 * a shuffle will not work. This is because it is very expensive to serialize and deserialize a GPU
 * Table using a conventional spark shuffle. Also most of the memory associated with the Table is
 * on the GPU itself, so each table must be closed when it is no longer needed to avoid running out
 * of GPU memory.  By convention it is the responsibility of the one consuming the data to close it
 * when they no longer need it.
