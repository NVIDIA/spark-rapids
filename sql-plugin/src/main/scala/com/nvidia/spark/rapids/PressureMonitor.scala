/**
 * Executor-level adaptive back-pressure monitor (Phase 0/1 of the adaptive
 * back-pressure design).
 *
 * A background daemon thread periodically samples two signals:
 *   - the JVM GC time fraction (GC ms per wall ms across all collectors), and
 *   - GPU device-memory utilization (`Rmm.getTotalBytesAllocated` / pool size).
 *
 * From these it maintains a single multiplicative back-pressure `factor` (>= 1.0).
 * [[GpuSemaphore]] multiplies its per-task GPU memory estimate by this factor, so a
 * larger factor makes each task take more permits and therefore reduces the number of
 * tasks allowed on the GPU concurrently. The factor uses AIMD control: it is increased
 * multiplicatively the moment either signal crosses its guard threshold, and decays
 * additively back to 1.0 while healthy.
 *
 * This is deliberately a WAIT-at-acquisition brake: a back-pressured task simply blocks
 * at the semaphore acquire *before* it holds any scarce GPU/host resource, so it cannot
 * deadlock and does no recompute. It throws no exception. The monitor is fully inert
 * (`factor() == 1.0`, no thread started) unless
 * `spark.rapids.adaptive.backpressure.enabled` is set.
 *
 * The GC guard targets the failure mode seen in production GPU runs where a CPU-era
 * `executor.cores` over-subscribes host memory, GC time climbs, and the executor is
 * eventually lost to a GC-overhead heartbeat timeout. Reducing GPU concurrency when GC
 * climbs keeps concurrent host/pinned memory in check adaptively, instead of relying on a
 * statically hand-tuned `concurrentGpuTasks` / `executor.cores`.
