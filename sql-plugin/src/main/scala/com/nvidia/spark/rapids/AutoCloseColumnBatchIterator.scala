/**
 * For columnar code on the CPU it is the responsibility of the SparkPlan exec that creates a
 * `ColumnarBatch` to close it.  In the case of code running on the GPU that would waste too
 * much memory, so it is the responsibility of the code receiving the batch to close it, when it
 * is not longer needed.
 *
 * This class provides a simple way for CPU batch code to be sure that a batch gets closed. If your
 * code is executing on the GPU do not use this class.
