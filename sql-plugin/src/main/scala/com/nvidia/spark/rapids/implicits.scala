     * safeMap: safeMap implementation that is leveraged by other type-specific implicits.
     *
     * safeMap has the added safety net that as you produce AutoCloseable values they are
     * tracked, and if an exception were to occur within the maps's body, it will make every
     * attempt to close each produced value.
     *
     * Note: safeMap will close in case of errors, without any knowledge of whether it should
     * or not.
     * Use safeMap only in these circumstances if `fn` increases the reference count,
     * producing an AutoCloseable, and nothing else is tracking these references:
     *    a) seq.safeMap(x => {...; x.incRefCount; x})
     *    b) seq.safeMap(x => GpuColumnVector.from(...))
     *
     * Usage of safeMap chained with other maps is a bit confusing:
     *
     * seq.map(GpuColumnVector.from).safeMap(couldThrow)
     *
     * Will close the column vectors produced from couldThrow up until the time where safeMap
     * throws.
     *
     * The correct pattern of usage in cases like this is:
     *
     *   val closeTheseLater = seq.safeMap(GpuColumnVector.from)
     *   closeTheseLater.safeMap{ x =>
     *     var success = false
     *     try {
     *       val res = couldThrow(x.incRefCount())
     *       success = true
     *       res // return a ref count of 2
     *     } finally {
     *       if (!success) {
     *         // in case of an error, we close x as part of normal error handling
     *         // the exception will be caught by the safeMap, and it will close all
     *         // AutoCloseables produced before x
     *         // - Sequence looks like: [2, 2, 2, ..., 2] + x, which has also has a refcount of 2
     *         x.close() // x now has a ref count of 1, the rest of the sequence has 2s
     *       }
     *     }
     *   } // safeMap cleaned, and now everything has 1s for ref counts (as they were before)
     *
     *   closeTheseLater.safeClose() // go from 1 to 0 in all things inside closeTheseLater
