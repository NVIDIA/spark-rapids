/**
 * A helper case class to maintain the state associated with a transfer request to a peer.
 *
 * The class implements the Iterator interface.
 *
 * On next(), a bounce buffer is returned earmarked for a range "window". The window
 * is composed of eventual target buffers that will be handed off to the catalog.
 *
 * By convention, the tag used is that of the first buffer contained in the payload. The
 * server follows the same convention in `BufferSendState`.
 *
 * `consumeWindow` is called when data has arrived at the bounce buffer, copying
 * onto the ranges the bytes received.
 *
 * It also is AutoCloseable. close() should be called to free bounce buffers.
 *
 * @param bounceBuffer - bounce buffer to use (device memory strictly)
 * @param requests - collection of `PendingTransferRequest` as issued by iterators
 *                 currently requesting
 * @param stream - CUDA stream to use for allocations and copies
