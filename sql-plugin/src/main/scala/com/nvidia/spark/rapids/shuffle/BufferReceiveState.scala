/**
 * A helper case class to maintain the state associated with a transfer request to a peer.
 *
 * On getBufferWhenReady(finalizeCb, size), a bounce buffer is either made
 * immediately available to `finalizeCb` or it will be made available later, via `toFinalize`.
 *
 * By convention, the `id` is used as the header for receives for this `BufferReceiveState`
 *
 * `consumeWindow` is called when data has arrived at the bounce buffer, copying
 * onto the ranges the bytes received.
 *
 * It also is AutoCloseable. close() should be called to free bounce buffers.
 *
 * @param id - a numeric id that is used in all headers for this `BufferReceiveState`
 * @param bounceBuffer - bounce buffer to use (device memory strictly)
 * @param requests - collection of `PendingTransferRequest` as issued by iterators
 *                 currently requesting
 * @param transportOnClose - a callback invoked when the `BufferReceiveState` closes
 * @param stream - CUDA stream to use for allocations and copies
