/**
 * This logical node is a placeholder in the plan for where, semantically, a Delta Lake
 * write occurs. Normally Delta Lake writes are *not* visible in the SQL plan, but we
 * use this as a workaround for undesired row transitions in the plan when adaptive
 * execution is enabled. Without it, AdaptiveSparkPlanExec can become the root node
 * of the physical plan to write into Delta. Without a parent node above
 * AdaptiveSparkPlanExec, the GPU transition planning does not know whether to make
 * the result of the adaptive plan GPU columnar or CPU row, so it ends up assuming CPU
 * row and injecting a columnar-to-row transition at the end of the plan. The Delta
 * write code cannot directly replace the AdaptiveSparkPlanExec to force it to be
 * columnar, because it's tied to the QueryExecution which can only be created with
 * logical plans. Thus our workaround is to inject a node in the logical plan for
 * the write and ensure the physical node appears to Spark as a command node so the
 * AdaptiveSparkPlanExec node is a child of it rather than the parent. The
 * InsertAdaptiveSparkPlan Rule in Spark will avoid placing the AdpativeSparkPlanExec
 * node in front of command-like nodes, and the physical form of this node is one
 * of those nodes.
