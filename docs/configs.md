# RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark Configuration
The following is the list of options that `rapids-plugin-4-spark` supports.

On startup use: `--conf [conf key]=[conf value]`. For example:

```
${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark --jars 'rapids-4-spark_2.12-22.04.0-SNAPSHOT.jar,cudf-22.04.0-SNAPSHOT-cuda11.jar' \
--conf spark.plugins=com.nvidia.spark.SQLPlugin \
--conf spark.rapids.sql.incompatibleOps.enabled=true
```

At runtime use: `spark.conf.set("[conf key]", [conf value])`. For example:

```
scala> spark.conf.set("spark.rapids.sql.incompatibleOps.enabled", true)
```

 All configs can be set on startup, but some configs, especially for shuffle, will not
 work if they are set at runtime.


## General Configuration

Name | Description | Default Value
-----|-------------|--------------
<a name="alluxio.pathsToReplace"></a>spark.rapids.alluxio.pathsToReplace|List of paths to be replaced with corresponding alluxio scheme. Eg, when configureis set to "s3:/foo->alluxio://0.1.2.3:19998/foo,gcs:/bar->alluxio://0.1.2.3:19998/bar", which means:       s3:/foo/a.csv will be replaced to alluxio://0.1.2.3:19998/foo/a.csv and      gcs:/bar/b.csv will be replaced to alluxio://0.1.2.3:19998/bar/b.csv|None

<a name="sql.format.orc.multiThreadedRead.maxNumFilesParallel"></a>spark.rapids.sql.format.orc.multiThreadedRead.maxNumFilesParallel|A limit on the maximum number of files per task processed in parallel on the CPU side before the file is sent to the GPU. This affects the amount of host memory used when reading the files in parallel. Used with MULTITHREADED reader, see spark.rapids.sql.format.orc.reader.type|2147483647
<a name="sql.format.orc.multiThreadedRead.numThreads"></a>spark.rapids.sql.format.orc.multiThreadedRead.numThreads|The maximum number of threads, on the executor, to use for reading small orc files in parallel.

<a name="sql.format.orc.reader.type"></a>spark.rapids.sql.format.orc.reader.type|Sets the orc reader type. We support different types that are optimized for different environments. The original Spark style reader can be selected by setting this to PERFILE which individually reads and copies files to the GPU. Loading many small files individually has high overhead, and using either COALESCING or MULTITHREADED is recommended instead. The COALESCING reader is good when using a local file system where the executors are on the same nodes or close to the nodes the data is being read on. This reader coalesces all the files assigned to a task into a single host buffer before sending it down to the GPU. It copies blocks from a single file into a host buffer in separate threads in parallel, see spark.rapids.sql.format.orc.multiThreadedRead.numThreads. MULTITHREADED is good for cloud environments where you are reading from a blobstore that is totally separate and likely has a higher I/O read cost. Many times the cloud environments also get better throughput when you have multiple readers in parallel. This reader uses multiple threads to read each file in parallel and each file is sent to the GPU separately. This allows the CPU to keep reading while GPU is also doing work. See spark.rapids.sql.format.orc.multiThreadedRead.numThreads and spark.rapids.sql.format.orc.multiThreadedRead.maxNumFilesParallel to control the number of threads and amount of memory used. By default this is set to AUTO so we select the reader we think is best. This will either be the COALESCING or the MULTITHREADED based on whether we think the file is in the cloud. See spark.rapids.cloudSchemes.|AUTO
<a name="sql.format.orc.write.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.format.orc.write.enabled|When set to false disables orc output acceleration|true
<a name="sql.format.parquet.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.format.parquet.enabled|When set to false disables all parquet input and output acceleration|true
<a name="sql.format.parquet.multiThreadedRead.maxNumFilesParallel"></a>spark.rapids.sql.format.parquet.multiThreadedRead.maxNumFilesParallel|A limit on the maximum number of files per task processed in parallel on the CPU side before the file is sent to the GPU.

<a name="sql.hasExtendedYearValues"></a>spark.rapids.sql.hasExtendedYearValues|Spark 3.2.0+ extended parsing of years in dates and timestamps to support the full range of possible values. Prior to this it was limited to a positive 4 digit year. The Accelerator does not support the extended range yet. This config indicates if your data includes this extended range or not, or if you don't care about getting the correct values on values with the extended range.|true
<a name="sql.hasNans"></a>spark.rapids.sql.hasNans|Config to indicate if your data has NaN's. Cudf doesn't currently support NaN's properly so you can get corrupt data if you have NaN's in your data and it runs on the GPU.|true
<a name="sql.hashOptimizeSort.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.hashOptimizeSort.enabled|Whether sorts should be inserted after some hashed operations to improve output ordering. This can improve output file sizes when saving to columnar formats.|false
<a name="sql.improvedFloatOps.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.improvedFloatOps.enabled|For some floating point operations spark uses one way to compute the value and the underlying cudf implementation can use an improved algorithm. In some cases this can result in cudf producing an answer when spark overflows. Because this is not as compatible with spark, we have it disabled by default.|false
<a name="sql.improvedTimeOps.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.improvedTimeOps.enabled|When set to true, some operators will avoid overflowing by converting epoch days  directly to seconds without first converting to microseconds|false
<a name="sql.incompatibleDateFormats.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.incompatibleDateFormats.enabled|When parsing strings as dates and timestamps in functions like unix_timestamp, some formats are fully supported on the GPU and some are unsupported and will fall back to the CPU.  Some formats behave differently on the GPU than the CPU.  Spark on the CPU interprets date formats with unsupported trailing characters as nulls, while Spark on the GPU will parse the date with invalid trailing characters. More detail can be found at [parsing strings as dates or timestamps](compatibility.md#parsing-strings-as-dates-or-timestamps).|false
<a name="sql.incompatibleOps.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.incompatibleOps.enabled|For operations that work, but are not 100% compatible with the Spark equivalent set if they should be enabled by default or disabled by default.|false
<a name="sql.join.cross.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.join.cross.enabled|When set to true cross joins are enabled on the GPU|true

<a name="sql.metrics.level"></a>spark.rapids.sql.metrics.level|GPU plans can produce a lot more metrics than CPU plans do. In very large queries this can sometimes result in going over the max result size limit for the driver. Supported values include DEBUG which will enable all metrics supported and typically only needs to be enabled when debugging the plugin. MODERATE which should output enough metrics to understand how long each part of the query is taking and how much data is going to each part of the query. ESSENTIAL which disables most metrics except those Apache Spark CPU plans will also report or their equivalents.|MODERATE
<a name="sql.mode"></a>spark.rapids.sql.mode|Set the mode for the Rapids Accelerator. The supported modes are explainOnly and executeOnGPU. This config can not be changed at runtime, you must restart the application for it to take affect. The default mode is executeOnGPU, which means the RAPIDS Accelerator plugin convert the Spark operations and execute them on the GPU when possible. The explainOnly mode allows running queries on the CPU and the RAPIDS Accelerator will evaluate the queries as if it was going to run on the GPU. The explanations of what would have run on the GPU and why are output in log messages. When using explainOnly mode, the default explain output is ALL, this can be changed by setting spark.rapids.sql.explain. See that config for more details.|executeongpu
<a name="sql.python.gpu.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.python.gpu.enabled|This is an experimental feature and is likely to change in the future. Enable (true) or disable (false) support for scheduling Python Pandas UDFs with GPU resources. When enabled, pandas UDFs are assumed to share the same GPU that the RAPIDs accelerator uses and will honor the python GPU configs|false
<a name="sql.reader.batchSizeBytes"></a>spark.rapids.sql.reader.batchSizeBytes|Soft limit on the maximum number of bytes the reader reads per batch. The readers will read chunks of data until this limit is met or exceeded. Note that the reader may estimate the number of bytes that will be used on the GPU in some cases based on the schema and number of rows in each batch.|2147483647
<a name="sql.reader.batchSizeRows"></a>spark.rapids.sql.reader.batchSizeRows|Soft limit on the maximum number of rows the reader will read per batch. The orc and parquet readers will read row groups until this limit is met or exceeded. The limit is respected by the csv reader.|2147483647
<a name="sql.regexp.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.regexp.enabled|Specifies whether regular expressions should be evaluated on GPU. Complex expressions can cause out of memory issues so this is disabled by default. Setting this config to true will make supported regular expressions run on the GPU. See the compatibility guide for more information about which regular expressions are supported on the GPU.|false

<a name="sql.rowBasedUDF.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.rowBasedUDF.enabled|When set to true, optimizes a row-based UDF in a GPU operation by transferring only the data it needs between GPU and CPU inside a query operation, instead of falling this operation back to CPU. This is an experimental feature, and this config might be removed in the future.|false
<a name="sql.shuffle.spillThreads"></a>spark.rapids.sql.shuffle.spillThreads|Number of threads used to spill shuffle data to disk in the background.|6
<a name="sql.stableSort.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.stableSort.enabled|Enable or disable stable sorting. Apache Spark's sorting is typically a stable sort, but sort stability cannot be guaranteed in distributed work loads because the order in which upstream data arrives to a task is not guaranteed. Sort stability then only matters when reading and sorting data from a file using a single task/partition. Because of limitations in the plugin when you enable stable sorting all of the data for a single task will be combined into a single batch before sorting. This currently disables spilling from GPU memory if the data size is too large.|false
<a name="sql.suppressPlanningFailure"></a>spark.rapids.sql.suppressPlanningFailure|Option to fallback an individual query to CPU if an unexpected condition prevents the query plan from being converted to a GPU-enabled one. Note this is different from a normal CPU fallback for a yet-to-be-supported Spark SQL feature. If this happens the error should be reported and investigated as a GitHub issue.|false
<a name="sql.udfCompiler.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.udfCompiler.enabled|When set to true, Scala UDFs will be considered for compilation as Catalyst expressions|false
<a name="sql.variableFloatAgg.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.variableFloatAgg.enabled|Spark assumes that all operations produce the exact same result each time. This is not true for some floating point aggregations, which can produce slightly different results on the GPU as the aggregation is done in parallel.  This can enable those operations if you know the query is only computing it once.|false
<a name="sql.window.range.byte.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.window.range.byte.enabled|When the order-by column of a range based window is byte type and the range boundary calculated for a value has overflow, CPU and GPU will get the different results. When set to false disables the range window acceleration for the byte type order-by column|false
<a name="sql.window.range.int.enabled"></a>spark.rapids.sql.window.range.int.enabled|When the order-by column of a range based window is int type and the range boundary calculated for a value has overflow, CPU and GPU will get the different results. When set to false disables the range window acceleration for the int type order-by column|true

## Supported GPU Operators and Fine Tuning
_The RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark_ can be configured to enable or disable specific
GPU accelerated expressions.  Enabled expressions are candidates for GPU execution. If the
expression is configured as disabled, the accelerator plugin will not attempt replacement,
and it will run on the CPU.

Please leverage the [`spark.rapids.sql.explain`](#sql.explain) setting to get
feedback from the plugin as to why parts of a query may not be executing on the GPU.

**NOTE:** Setting
[`spark.rapids.sql.incompatibleOps.enabled=true`](#sql.incompatibleOps.enabled)
will enable all the settings in the table below which are not enabled by default due to
incompatibilities.
