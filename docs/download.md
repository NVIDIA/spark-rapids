## Release v0.4.0

New functionality for the release includes
* Decimal support up to 64 bit, including reading and writing decimal from Parquet (can be enabled
  by setting `spark.rapids.sql.decimalType.enabled` to True)
* Ability for users to provide GPU versions of Scala, Java or Hive UDFs
* Shuffle and sort support for `struct` data types
* `array_contains` for list operations
* `collect_list` and `average` for windowing operations
* Murmur3 `hash` operation 
* Improved performance when reading from DataSource v2 when the source produces data in the Arrow format

This release includes additional performance improvements, including
* RAPIDS Shuffle with UCX performance improvements
* Instructions on how to use [Alluxio caching](get-started/getting-started-alluxio.md) with Spark to
  leverage caching.

The release is supported on Apache Spark 3.0.0, 3.0.1, 3.0.2, 3.1.1, Databricks 7.3 ML LTS and
Google Cloud Platform Dataproc 2.0.

The list of all supported operations is provided [here](supported_ops.md).

## Release v0.2.0
This is the second release of the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark.  Adaptive Query Execution
[SPARK-31412](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31412) is a new enhancement that was
included in Spark 3.0 that alters the physical execution plan dynamically to improve the performance
of the query.  The RAPIDS Accelerator v0.2 introduces Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) for GPUs and
leverages columnar processing [SPARK-32332](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32332)
starting from Spark 3.0.1.

Another enhancement in v0.2 is improvement in reading small Parquet files.  This feature takes into
account the scenario where input data can be stored across many small files.  By leveraging multiple
CPU threads v0.2 delivers up to 6x performance improvement over the previous release for small
Parquet file reads.

The RAPIDS Accelerator introduces a beta feature that accelerates [Spark shuffle for
GPUs](get-started/getting-started-on-prem.md#enabling-rapidsshufflemanager).  Accelerated
shuffle makes use of high bandwidth transfers between GPUs (NVLink or p2p over PCIe) and leverages
RDMA (RoCE or Infiniband) for remote transfers.
