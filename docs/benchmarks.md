# Benchmarks

The `integration_test` module contains benchmarks derived from the 
[TPC-DS](http://www.tpc.org/tpcds/), [TPC-H](http://www.tpc.org/tpch/), and 
[TPCx-BB](http://www.tpc.org/tpcx-bb/default5.asp) benchmarks. These are not official TPC 
benchmarks and are only intended to be used to compare relative performance between CPU and GPU 
and to help catch performance regressions in the plugin.

## Data Generation

For each of these benchmarks, source data must be generated by a utility that can generate data at
any scale factor, where the scale factor is an integer representing approximately how many
gigabytes of data will be generated, with scale factor 1 meaning ~1 GB, and scale factor 1000 meaning ~1 TB,
for example.

Further information on data generation can be found using the following links:

- [TPC-DS Data Generator](https://github.com/databricks/tpcds-kit)
- [TPC-H Data Generator](https://github.com/electrum/tpch-dbgen)
- [TPCx-BB Data Generator](http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/current_specifications5.asp)

The remainder of this document is based on the TPC-DS benchmark but the steps are very similar for
the other benchmarks. The main difference is that the package and class name is different for each
benchmark.

| Benchmark | Package                              | Class Names                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| TPC-DS    | com.nvidia.spark.rapids.tests.tpcds  | ConvertFiles, TpcdsLikeBench   |
| TPC-xBB   | com.nvidia.spark.rapids.tests.tpcxbb | ConvertFiles, TpcxbbLikeBench  |
| TPC-H     | com.nvidia.spark.rapids.tests.tpch   | ConvertFiles, TpchLikeBench    |

## Spark Shell

The integration test jar needs to be added to the `--jars` configuration option when launching the
Spark shell. This jar can be found in the `integration_tests/target` directory after running
`mvn package`, with a filename matching `rapids-4-spark-integration-tests_2.12-0.4.0.jar`.

To run benchmarks on the GPU, the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark must also be installed,
following the instructions provided in the [Getting Started](get-started/getting-started.md) guide.

## Converting to Parquet

Although it is possible to run benchmarks directly against the CSV data generated by the TPC data 
generators, it is common to convert the data to Parquet format and run benchmarks against the 
Parquet files instead.

The `integration_test` module contains code for converting the CSV data sets to Parquet.

The following commands can be entered into spark-shell to perform the conversion.

```scala
import com.nvidia.spark.rapids.tests.tpcds._
TpcdsLikeSpark.csvToParquet(spark, "/path/to/input", "/path/to/output")
```

Note that the code for converting CSV to Parquet does not explicitly specify the number of 
partitions to write, so the size of the resulting parquet files will vary depending on the value 
for `spark.default.parallelism`, which by default is based on the number of available executor
cores. However, the file conversion methods accept `coalesce` and `repartition` arguments to
better control the size of the partitions on a per-table basis.

Example using `coalesce` and `repartition` options to control the number and size of partitions
for specific tables.

```scala
TpcdsLikeSpark.csvToParquet(spark, "/path/to/input", "/path/to/output", 
  coalesce=Map("customer_address" -> 1), repartition=Map("web_sales" -> 256))
```

It is also possible to use `spark-submit` to run the file conversion process.

```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
    --master $SPARK_MASTER_URL \
    --jars $SPARK_RAPIDS_PLUGIN_JAR,$CUDF_JAR \
    --class com.nvidia.spark.rapids.tests.tpcds.ConvertFiles \
    $SPARK_RAPIDS_PLUGIN_INTEGRATION_TEST_JAR \
    --input /path/to/input \
    --output /path/to/output \
    --output-format parquet \
    --coalesce customer_address=1 \
    --repartition web_sales=256 inventory=128
```

It should also be noted that no decimal types will be output. The conversion code uses explicit 
schemas to ensure that decimal types are converted to floating-point types instead because the
plugin does not yet support decimal types but these will be supported in a future release.

## Running Benchmarks from a Spark shell

The benchmarks can be executed in two modes currently:

- Execute the query and collect the results to the driver
- Execute the query and write the results to disk (in Parquet, CSV, or ORC format)

The following commands can be entered into spark-shell to register the data files that the 
benchmark will query.

```scala
import com.nvidia.spark.rapids.tests.tpcds._
TpcdsLikeSpark.setupAllParquet(spark, "/path/to/tpcds")
```

The benchmark can be executed with the following syntax to execute the query and collect the 
results to the driver.

```scala
import com.nvidia.spark.rapids.tests._
val benchmark = new BenchmarkRunner(new TpcdsLikeBench())
benchmark.collect(spark, "q5", iterations=3)
```

The benchmark can be executed with the following syntax to execute the query and write the results 
to Parquet. There are also `writeCsv` and `writeOrc` methods for writing the output to CSV or ORC 
files.

```scala
import com.nvidia.spark.rapids.tests._
val benchmark = new BenchmarkRunner(new TpcdsLikeBench())
benchmark.writeParquet(spark, "q5", "/data/output/tpcds/q5", iterations=3)
```

## Running Benchmarks from spark-submit

The benchmark runner has a command-line interface, allowing it to be submitted 
to Spark using `spark-submit` which can be more practical than using the Spark shell when 
running a series of benchmarks using automation.

Here is an example `spark-submit` command for running TPC-DS query 5, reading from Parquet and 
writing results to Parquet. The `--output` and `--output-format` arguments can be omitted to 
have the benchmark call `collect()` on the results instead. 

```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
    --master $SPARK_MASTER_URL \
    --jars $SPARK_RAPIDS_PLUGIN_JAR,$CUDF_JAR \
    --class com.nvidia.spark.rapids.tests.BenchmarkRunner \
    $SPARK_RAPIDS_PLUGIN_INTEGRATION_TEST_JAR \
    --benchmark tpcds \
    --query q5 \
    --input /raid/tpcds-3TB-parquet-largefiles \
    --input-format parquet \
    --output /raid/tpcds-output/tpcds-q5-cpu \
    --output-format parquet \
    --summary-file-prefix tpcds-q5-cpu \
    --iterations 1
```

## Benchmark JSON Output

Each benchmark run produces a JSON file containing information about the environment and the query, 
including the following items:

- Spark version
- Spark configuration
- Environment variables
- Logical and physical query plan
- SQL metrics for the executed plan
- Timing information for each query iteration

Care should be taken to ensure that no sensitive information is captured from the environment 
before sharing these JSON files. Environment variables with names containing the words `PASSWORD`, 
`TOKEN`, or `SECRET` are filtered out, but this may not be sufficient to prevent leaking secrets.

## Automating Benchmarks

For convenience, the [benchmark.py](../integration_tests/src/main/python/benchmark.py) script is
provided, allowing benchmarks to be run in an automated way with multiple configurations. Example
usage is provided in the documentation within the script.

## Verifying Results

It is important to verify that queries actually produced the correct output, especially when 
comparing between CPU and GPU benchmarks. A utility is provided to help with this.

This is a simple utility that pulls results down to the driver for comparison so will only work for 
data sets that can fit in the  driver's memory. 

If data needs sorting before comparison, this is delegated to Spark before collecting the results.

Example usage from spark-shell:

```scala
val cpu = spark.read.parquet("/data/tpcxbb/q5-cpu")
val gpu = spark.read.parquet("/data/tpcxbb/q5-gpu")
import com.nvidia.spark.rapids.tests.common._
BenchUtils.compareResults(cpu, gpu, inputFormat="parquet", ignoreOrdering=true, epsilon=0.0001)
```

This will report on any differences between the two dataframes.

The verification utility can also be run using `spark-submit` using the following syntax.

```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
    --master $SPARK_MASTER_URL \
    --jars $SPARK_RAPIDS_PLUGIN_JAR,$CUDF_JAR \
    --class com.nvidia.spark.rapids.tests.common.CompareResults \
    $SPARK_RAPIDS_PLUGIN_INTEGRATION_TEST_JAR \
    --input1 /path/to/result1 \
    --input2 /path/to/result2 \
    --input-format parquet
```
