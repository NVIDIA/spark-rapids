# Getting started with RAPIDS Accelerator on Azure Synapse Analytics
 [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/) is an analytics service that brings
 together enterprise data warehousing and Big Data analytics.

Synapse now offers the ability to create Apache Spark pools that use GPUs on the backend to run your Spark workloads on 
GPUs for accelerated processing. These are called as 
[GPU-accelerated Apache Spark pools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-gpu-concept).
Currently it ships with the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark version 21.10.
