# Getting started with RAPIDS Accelerator on Databricks
This guide will run through how to set up the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark 3.0 on Databricks. At the end of this guide, the reader will be able to run a sample Apache Spark application that runs on NVIDIA GPUs on Databricks.

## Prerequisites
* Apache Spark 3.0 running in DataBricks Runtime 7.0 ML with GPU 
    * AWS: 7.0 ML (includes Apache Spark 3.0.0, GPU, Scala 2.12)
    * Azure: 7.0 ML (GPU, Scala 2.12, Spark 3.0.0)

The number of GPUs per node dictates the number of Spark executors that can run in that node.

## Start a Databricks Cluster
Create a Databricks cluster by going to Clusters, then clicking “+ Create Cluster”. Ensure the cluster meets the prerequisites above by configuring it as follows:
1. On AWS, make sure to use 7.0 ML (includes Apache Spark 3.0.0, GPU, Scala 2.12), or for Azure, choose 7.0 ML (GPU, Scala 2.12, Spark 3.0.0).
2. Under Autopilot Options, disable auto scaling.
3. Choose the number of workers that matches the number of GPUs you want to use.
4. Select a worker type. On AWS, use nodes with 1 GPU each such as p3.xlarge or g4dn.xlarge. p2 nodes do not meet the architecture requirements for the Spark worker (although they can be used for the driver node). For Azure, choose GPU nodes such as Standard_NC6s_v3
5. Select the driver type. Generally this can be set to be the same as the worker.

## Advance Cluster Configuration

We will need to create an initialization script for the cluster that installs the RAPIDS jars to the cluster.

1. To create the initialization script, import the initialization script notebook from the repo [generate-init-script.ipynb](../demo/Databricks/generate-init-script.ipynb) to your workspace. See [Managing Notebooks](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/notebooks/notebook-manage.html) on how to import a notebook, then open the notebook.
2. Once you are in the notebook, click the “Run All” button.
3. Ensure that the newly created init.sh script is present in the output from cell 2 and that the contents of the script are correct..
4. Go back and edit your cluster to configure it to use the init script. To do this, click the “Clusters” button on the left panel, then select your cluster.
5. Click the “Edit” button, then navigate down to the “Advanced Options” section.
Select the “Init Scripts” tab in the advanced options section, and paste the initialization script: `dbfs:/databricks/init_scripts/init.sh`, then click “Add”

6. Now select the “Spark” tab, and paste the following config options into the Spark Config section:
    ```bash
    spark.plugins com.nvidia.spark.SQLPlugin
    spark.sql.parquet.filterPushdown false
    spark.rapids.sql.incompatibleOps.enabled true
    spark.rapids.memory.pinnedPool.size 2G
    spark.locality.wait 0s
    spark.hadoop.mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version 2
    spark.executor.extraJavaOptions "-Dai.rapids.cudf.prefer-pinned=true"
    ```

![Spark Config](../img/sparkconfig.png)

7. Once you’ve added the Spark config, click “Confirm and Restart”.
8. Once the cluster comes back up, it is now enabled for GPU-accelerated Spark with RAPIDS and cuDF.

## Import the GPU Mortgage Example Notebook
Import the example [notebook](../demo/gpu-mortgage_accelerated.ipynb) from the repo into your workspace, then open the notebook.
Modify the first cell to point to your workspace, and download a larger dataset if needed. You can find the links to the datasets at [docs.rapids.ai](https://docs.rapids.ai/datasets/mortgage-data)

```bash
%sh
 
wget http://rapidsai-data.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/notebook-mortgage-data/mortgage_2000.tgz -P /Users/<your user id>/
 
mkdir -p /dbfs/FileStore/tables/mortgage
mkdir -p /dbfs/FileStore/tables/mortgage_parquet_gpu/perf
mkdir /dbfs/FileStore/tables/mortgage_parquet_gpu/acq
mkdir /dbfs/FileStore/tables/mortgage_parquet_gpu/output
 
tar xfvz /Users/<your user id>/mortgage_2000.tgz --directory /dbfs/FileStore/tables/mortgage
```

In Cell 3, update the data paths if necessary. The example notebook merges the columns and prepares the data for XGoost training. The temp and final output results are written back to the dbfs
```bash
orig_perf_path='dbfs:///FileStore/tables/mortgage/perf/*'
orig_acq_path='dbfs:///FileStore/tables/mortgage/acq/*'
tmp_perf_path='dbfs:///FileStore/tables/mortgage_parquet_gpu/perf/'
tmp_acq_path='dbfs:///FileStore/tables/mortgage_parquet_gpu/acq/'
output_path='dbfs:///FileStore/tables/mortgage_parquet_gpu/output/'
```
Run the notebook by clicking “Run All”
