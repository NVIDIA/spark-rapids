# RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark Nvtx Range Glossary
The following is the list of Nvtx ranges that are used throughout
the plugin. To add your own Nvtx range to the code, create an NvtxId
entry in NvtxRangeWithDoc.scala and create an `NvtxRangeWithDoc` in the
code location that you want to cover, passing in the newly created NvtxId.

See [nvtx_profiling.md](https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/docs/dev/nvtx_profiling.html) for more info.



## Nvtx Ranges

Name | Description
-----|-------------
getMapSizesByExecId|Call to internal Spark API for retrieving size and location of shuffle map output blocks
probe right|Probing the right side of a join input iterator to get the data size for preparing the join
fetch join stream|stream iterator time for GpuShuffleSizeHashJoinExec
shuffled join stream|GpuShuffledHashJoinExec op is preparing build batches for join
Acquire GPU|Time waiting for GPU semaphore to be acquired
Release GPU|Releasing the GPU semaphore
GpuCoalesceBatches: collect|GPU combining of small batches post-kernel processing
broadcast join stream|GpuBroadcastHashJoinExec.getBroadcastBuiltBatchAndStreamIter -  Gets the ColumnarBatch for the build side and the stream iterator by acquiring the GPU only after first stream batch has been streamed to GPU.
CommitShuffle|After all temporary shuffle writes are done, produce a single file (shuffle_[map_id]_0) in the commit phase
ParallelDeserializerIterator.next|Calling next on the MT shuffle reader iterator
queueFetched|MT shuffle manager is using the RapidsShuffleBlockFetcherIterator to queue the next set of fetched results
WaitingForWrites|Rapids Shuffle Manager (multi threaded) is waiting for any queued writes to finish before finalizing the map output writer
AbstractGpuCoalesceIterator|Default range for a code path in the AbstractGpuCoalesceIterator for an op which is not explicitly documented in its own range
ThreadedWriter.write|Rapids Shuffle Manager (multi threaded) writing
ThreadedReader.read|Rapids Shuffle Manager (multi threaded) reading
hash join build|
probe left|Probing the left side of a join input iterator to get the data size for preparing the join
build batch: collect|Perform a join where the build side fits in a single GPU batch
BatchWait|Rapids Shuffle Manager (multi threaded) reader blocked waiting for batches to finish decoding
RapidsCachingWriter.write|Rapids Shuffle Manager (ucx) writing
