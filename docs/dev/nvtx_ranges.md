# RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark Nvtx Range Glossary
The following is the list of Nvtx ranges that are used throughout
the plugin. To add your own Nvtx range to the code, create an NvtxId
entry in NvtxRangeWithDoc.scala and create an `NvtxRangeWithDoc` in the
code location that you want to cover, passing in the newly created NvtxId.

See [nvtx_profiling.md](https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/docs/dev/nvtx_profiling.html) for more info.
