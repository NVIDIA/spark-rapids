# RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark Nvtx Range Glossary
The following is the list of Nvtx ranges that are used throughout
the plugin. To add your own Nvtx range to the code, create an NvtxId
entry in NvtxRangeWithDoc.scala and create an `NvtxRangeWithDoc` in the
code location that you want to cover, passing in the newly created NvtxId.

See [nvtx_profiling.md](https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/docs/dev/nvtx_profiling.html) for more info.



## Nvtx Ranges

Name | Description
-----|-------------
getMapSizesByExecId|Call to internal Spark API for retrieving size and location of shuffle map output blocks
gpuKudoSerialize|Perform kudo serialization on the gpu
Acquire GPU|Time waiting for GPU semaphore to be acquired
Release GPU|Releasing the GPU semaphore
gpuKudoSliceBuffers|slice kudo serialized buffers on host into partitions
CommitShuffle|After all temporary shuffle writes are done, produce a single file (shuffle_[map_id]_0) in the commit phase
ParallelDeserializerIterator.next|Calling next on the MT shuffle reader iterator
queueFetched|MT shuffle manager is using the RapidsShuffleBlockFetcherIterator to queue the next set of fetched results
WaitingForWrites|Rapids Shuffle Manager (multi threaded) is waiting for any queued writes to finish before finalizing the map output writer
ThreadedWriter.write|Rapids Shuffle Manager (multi threaded) writing
ThreadedReader.read|Rapids Shuffle Manager (multi threaded) reading
gpuKudoCopyToHost|copy gpu kudo serialized outputs back to the host
