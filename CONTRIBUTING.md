# Contributing to RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark

Contributions to RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark fall into the following three categories.

1. To report a bug, request a new feature, or report a problem with
    documentation, please file an [issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/new/choose)
    describing in detail the problem or new feature. The project team evaluates
    and triages issues, and schedules them for a release. If you believe the
    issue needs priority attention, please comment on the issue to notify the
    team.
2. To propose and implement a new Feature, please file a new feature request
    [issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids/issues/new/choose). Describe the
    intended feature and discuss the design and implementation with the team and
    community. Once the team agrees that the plan looks good, go ahead and
    implement it using the [code contributions](#code-contributions) guide below.
3. To implement a feature or bug-fix for an existing outstanding issue, please
    follow the [code contributions](#code-contributions) guide below. If you
    need more context on a particular issue, please ask in a comment.

## Branching Convention

There are two types of branches in this repository:

* `branch-[version]`: are development branches which can change often. Note that we merge into
  the branch with the greatest version number, as that is our default branch.

* `main`: is the branch with the latest released code, and the version tag (i.e. `v0.1.0`)
  is held here. `main` will change with new releases, but otherwise it should not change with
  every pull request merged, making it a more stable branch.

## Building From Source

We use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) for most aspects of the build. Some important parts
of the build execute in the `verify` phase of the Maven build lifecycle.  We recommend when
building at least running to the `verify` phase, e.g.:

```shell script
mvn verify
```

After a successful build the RAPIDS Accelerator jar will be in the `dist/target/` directory.
This will build the plugin for a single version of Spark.  By default this is Apache Spark
3.0.1. To build against other versions of Spark you use the `-Dbuildver=XXX` command line option
to Maven. For instance to build Spark 3.1.1 you would use:

```shell script
mvn -Dbuildver=311 verify
```
You can find all available build versions in the top level pom.xml file. If you are building
for Databricks then you should use the `jenkins/databricks/build.sh` script and modify it for
the version you want.

To get an uber jar with more than 1 version you have to `mvn install` each version
and then use one of the defined profiles in the dist module. See the next section
for more details.

### Building a Distribution for Multiple Versions of Spark

By default the distribution jar only includes code for a single version of Spark. If you want
to create a jar with multiple versions we currently have 4 options.

1. Build for all Apache Spark versions and CDH with no SNAPSHOT versions of Spark, only released. Use `-PnoSnapshots`.
2. Build for all Apache Spark versions and CDH including SNAPSHOT versions of Spark we have supported for. Use `-Psnapshots`.
3. Build for all Apache Spark versions, CDH and Databricks with no SNAPSHOT versions of Spark, only released. Use `-PnoSnaphsotsWithDatabricks`.
4. Build for all Apache Spark versions, CDH and Databricks including SNAPSHOT versions of Spark we have supported for. Use `-PsnapshotsWithDatabricks`

You must first build and install each of the versions of Spark and then build one final time using the profile for the option you want.

There is a build script `build/buildall` to build everything with snapshots and this will have more options to build later.

You can also install some manually and build a combined jar. For instance to build non-snapshot versions:

```shell script
mvn -Dbuildver=301 clean install -DskipTests
mvn -Dbuildver=302 clean install -Drat.skip=true -DskipTests
mvn -Dbuildver=303 clean install -Drat.skip=true -DskipTests
mvn -Dbuildver=311 clean install -Drat.skip=true -DskipTests
mvn -Dbuildver=312 clean install -Drat.skip=true -DskipTests
mvn -Dbuildver=311cdh clean install -Drat.skip=true -DskipTests
mvn -pl dist -PnoSnapshots package -DskipTests
```

### Building against different CUDA Toolkit versions

You can build against different versions of the CUDA Toolkit by using one of the following profiles:
* `-Pcuda11` (CUDA 11.0/11.1/11.2, default)

## Code contributions

### Source code layout

Conventional code locations in Maven modules are found under `src/main/<language>`. In addition to
that and in order to support multiple versions of Apache Spark with the minimum amount of source
code we maintain Spark-version-specific locations within non-shim modules if necessary. This allows
us to switch between incompatible parent classes inside without copying the shared code to
dedicated shim modules.

Thus, the conventional source code root directories `src/main/<language>` contain the files that
are source-compatible with all supported Spark releases, both upstream and vendor-specific.

The version-specific directory names have one of the following forms / use cases:
- `src/main/312/scala` contains Scala source code for a single Spark version, 3.1.2 in this case
- `src/main/312+-apache/scala`contains Scala source code for *upstream* **Apache** Spark builds,
   only beginning with version Spark 3.1.2, and + signifies there is no upper version boundary
   among the supported versions
- `src/main/302until312-all` contains code that applies to all shims between 3.0.2 *inclusive*,
3.1.2 *exclusive*
- `src/main/302to312-cdh` contains code that applies to Cloudera CDH shims between 3.0.2 *inclusive*,
   3.1.2 *inclusive*


### Setting up an Integrated Development Environment

Our project currently uses `build-helper-maven-plugin` for shimming against conflicting definitions of superclasses 
in upstream versions that cannot be resolved without significant code duplication otherwise. To this end different 
source directories with differently implemented same-named classes are 
[added](https://www.mojohaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/add-source-mojo.html) 
for compilation depending on the targeted Spark version.

This may require some modifications to IDEs' standard Maven import functionality.

#### IntelliJ IDEA

_Last tested with 2021.2.1 Community Edition_

To start working with the project in IDEA is as easy as 
[opening](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2008/03/opening-maven-projects-is-easy-as-pie/) the top level (parent) 
[pom.xml](pom.xml). 

In order to make sure that IDEA handles profile-specific source code roots within a single Maven module correctly,
[unselect](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2021.2/maven-importing.html) "Keep source and test folders on reimport".

If you develop a feature that has to interact with the Shim layer or simply need to test the Plugin with a different
Spark version, open [Maven tool window](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2021.2/maven-projects-tool-window.html) and
select one of the `release3xx` profiles (e.g, `release320`) for Apache Spark 3.2.0, and click "Reload" 
if not triggered automatically.

There is a known issue with the shims/spark3xx submodules. After being enabled once, a module such as shims/spark312 
may remain active in IDEA even though you explicitly disable the Maven profile `release312` in the Maven tool window.
With an extra IDEA shim module loaded the IDEA internal build "Build->Build Project" is likely to fail 
(whereas it has no adverse effect on Maven build). As a workaround, locate the pom.xml under the extraneous IDEA module,
right-click on it and select "Maven->Ignore Projects".

If you see Scala symbols unresolved (highlighted red) in IDEA please try the following steps to resolve it:
- Make sure there are no relevant poms in "File->Settings->Build Tools->Maven->Ignored Files" 
- Restart IDEA and click "Reload All Maven Projects" again

### Sign your work

We require that all contributors sign-off on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not signed off will not be accepted.

To sign off on a commit use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

```shell
git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
```

This will append the following to your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. Use your real name, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.  If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.


The signoff means you certify the below (from [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org)):

```

### Testing Your Code
Please visit the [testing doc](tests/README.md) for details about how to run tests


### Pre-commit hooks
We provide a basic config `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to
automate some aspects of the development process. As a convenience you can enable automatic 
copyright year updates by following the installation instructions on the
[pre-commit homepage](https://pre-commit.com/).

To this end, first install `pre-commit` itself using the method most suitable for your development
environment. Then you will need to run `pre-commit install` to enable it in your local git
repository. Using `--allow-missing-config` will make it easy to work with older branches
that do not have `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

```bash
pre-commit install --allow-missing-config
```

and setting the environment variable:

```bash
export SPARK_RAPIDS_AUTO_COPYRIGHTER=ON
```
The default value of `SPARK_RAPIDS_AUTO_COPYRIGHTER` is `OFF`.

When automatic copyright updater is enabled and you modify a file with a prior
year in the copyright header it will be updated on `git commit` to the current year automatically.
However, this will abort the [commit process](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/532)
with the following error message:
```
Update copyright year....................................................Failed
- hook id: auto-copyrighter
- duration: 0.01s
- files were modified by this hook
```
You can confirm that the update actually has happened by either inspecting its effect with
`git diff` first or simply reexecuting `git commit` right away. The second time no file
modification should be triggered by the copyright year update hook and the commit should succeed.

### Pull request status checks
A pull request should pass all status checks before merged.
#### signoff check
Please follow the steps in the [Sign your work](#sign-your-work) section,
and make sure at least one commit in your pull request get signed-off.
#### blossom-ci
The check runs on NVIDIA self-hosted runner, a [project committer](.github/workflows/blossom-ci.yml#L36) can
manually trigger it by commenting `build`. It includes following steps,
1. Mergeable check
2. Blackduck vulnerability scan
3. Fetch merged code (merge the pull request HEAD into BASE branch, e.g. fea-001 into branch-x)
4. Run `mvn verify` and unit tests for multiple Spark versions in parallel. 
Ref: [spark-premerge-build.sh](jenkins/spark-premerge-build.sh)

If it fails, you can click the `Details` link of this check, and go to `Upload log -> Jenkins log for pull request xxx (click here)` to
find the uploaded log.

Options:
1. Skip tests run by adding `[skip ci]` to title, this should only be used for doc-only change
2. Run build and tests in databricks runtimes by adding `[databricks]` to title, this would add around 30-40 minutes
