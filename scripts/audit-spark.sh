# This script generates the commits that went in Apache Spark for audit.
# Audit is required to evaluate if the code needs to be updated based
# on new commits merged in Apache Spark. This currently audits changes for
# Spark master branch by default. The script can be run for different branches by providing
# the argument -b along with the branch name.
# Arguments:
#   lastcommit - File which contains the latest commit hash when this script ran last.
#   basebranch - branch in Apache Spark for which commits needs to be audited.
#                Currently it's Apache Spark's master branch(Spark-3.3-SNAPSHOT).
#   tag        - tag until which the commits are audited

    ## Below sequence of commands were used to get the initial list of commits to audit branch-3.3-SNAPSHOT(which is currently `master` branch)
    ## It filters out all the commits that were audited until branch-3.2
    ## There wasn't easy way to get the list of commits to audit for branch-3.3-SNAPSHOT.
    ## Spark release works in this way -  Once the release branch is cut, PR's are merged into master and then cherry-picked to release branches.
    ## This causes different commit ids for the same PR in different branches(master & release branch).
    ## We need to find the common parent before branch-3.2 was cut. In this case commit id 79a6e00b7621bb is the one.
    ## So we get all commits from master and branch-3.2 until the common parent commit and then filter it based on commit header message i.e
    ## if the commit header is same, it means it is cherry-picked to branch-3.2(implying that commit is already audited).
