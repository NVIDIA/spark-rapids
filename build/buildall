# Install all the versions we support

# First loop over all supported versions except for 301 skipping expensive plugins that
# - either deferred to 301 because the check is identical in all shim profiles such as scalastyle
# - or deferred to 301 because we currently don't require it per shim such as javadoc generation
# - or there is a dedicated step to run against a particular shim jar such as unit tests, in
#   the near future we will run unit tests against a combined multi-shim jar to catch classloading
#   regressions even before pytest-based integration_tests
