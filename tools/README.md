# Qualification and Profiling tools

The Qualification tool is used to look at a set of applications to determine if the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark
might be a good fit for those applications.

The Profiling tool generates information which can be used for debugging and profiling applications.
Information such as Spark version, executor information, properties and so on. This runs on either CPU or
GPU generated event logs.

Please refer to [Qualification tool documentation](../docs/qualification-tool.md) 
and [Profiling tool documentation](../docs/profiling-tool.md)
for more details on how to use the tools.
